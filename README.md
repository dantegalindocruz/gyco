# Get Yo Craft On

This is a site that I'm putting together for the community of the city of Chattanooga to teach them how to knit and crochet at no cost.

The goal for this site is not to show off my skills as a developer. But to promote the health benefits that these classes offer which are:
   + Reduces chronic pain
   + Reduces anxiety
   + Reduces depression
   + Builds confidence
   + Lowers blood pressure
   + Helps those suffering from PTSD
   + Helps delay the onset of dementia.
   + Helps abuse victims
   + Gives a sense of purpose
   + Increases happiness
   + Creates a sense of accomplishment by doing something you never thought you could.
   
I'm hoping by the end of the year to bring the gift of crafting to at least #100 people. 

The reason why this mission is so important to me is because I myself was a victim of mental, sexual, and physical abuse. I was also almost a victim of shooting on three different occasions, not because of anything that I did, but because I lived in some really rough areas of the city, which as a result I suffer from PTSD. And when I was 15, I suffered a compound fracture in my right arm/hand and was not really able to use my right hand without experiencing pain. But thanks to crocheting and knitting I have more mobility than I previously had. 

I also was someone who didn't have a lot of confidence in myself. But thanks to my friend Melanie Dobbs Gibbs, who taught me how to crochet 13 years ago when I was homeless, I'm now confident enough to not only craft anywhere, but I'm confident to teach these classes and give this awesome gift to others. 

Here's a link to the magazine article that Melanie and I were included in for _Chatter Magazine_:
